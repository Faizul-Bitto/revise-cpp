## ðŸ“– Key C++ Syntax Summary

- **Comments:** Use `//` for single-line comments
- **Semicolons:** Every statement ends with `;`
- **Braces:** Use `{ }` to group code blocks
- **Case Sensitive:** `cout` and `Cout` are different
- **Headers:** `#include <iostream>` or `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
- **Namespace:** `using namespace std;` to use standard functions
